# accumulator-game

## About the Project

The acculumator game is a silly game where you can make money by clicking on a dollar bill and by purchasing and upgrading businesses. You are able to compare your fake wealth to real people's net worth and "buy" real luxury properties.

## Usage

All necessary files are located in the `/dist` folder. Clone the project and then open that folder in your editor of choice.

### Built With

- HTML
- SCSS
- Javascript
- Gulp

### Future Plans

I intend to continue to develop this game in the future by:

- Rebuilding in Vue
- Adding more real world properties and items to buy
- Use an API to dynamically change the net worth of real world people as their net worth flucuates
- Fix any bugs that are found and imporove UX
